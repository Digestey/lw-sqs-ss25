Motivation
==========

Pokemon has always been a big part of my childhood, dating back to 2010 when I first got in touch with the series
playing Pokemon HeartGold on my DS. Since then Pokemon has always been a big part of my life, playing most games
released since then.

The idea to make a little quiz stems from the Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket that was launched in October of 2024
and quickly became a staple for me to play. Inspired by what can only be described as a "shower thought", why not make
something use the PokeAPI for this project. And thus, the idea of DexQuiz was born. At first, I wanted to do something
that more resembled the PTCGP app, but since two other students of this course called dibs on that idea, a revertion to
a quiz it is.
