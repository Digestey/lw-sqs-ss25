# 1. Way of handling connections to the database

## Context

For my first Proof of Concept (PoC), I used a single database connection to interact with the MySQL database. However, after reviewing the code and considering scalability and long-term maintainability, I am exploring alternative strategies for handling database connections. Specifically, I am evaluating approaches that provide better management of database connections, such as connection pooling or using a singleton pattern to handle database connections more efficiently.

## Decision

- **Use connection pooling** (as provided by `mysql.connector` or another pooling library) for managing database connections in the production environment. Pooling allows for efficient reuse of connections, which is critical for performance when the application scales. 
- For the development and testing phases, we will use a **Singleton pattern** to manage a single connection instance. This will simplify testing and reduce overhead in environments where the database load is expected to be light.

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Pooling (via `mysql.connector` or another pooling library)**:
   - Pooling creates a pool of reusable database connections. It reduces the overhead of establishing new connections for every database operation, improving performance, particularly in high-load or multi-threaded environments. It's the preferred approach for production environments.
   - **Pros**:
     - Reduces the overhead of creating and destroying connections.
     - Allows for better resource management in high-load scenarios.
   - **Cons**:
     - Slightly more complex to configure compared to using a single connection.
     - Might require additional testing and tuning to optimize the pool size.

2. **Singleton (one connection instance for all operations)**:
   - A singleton pattern ensures that only one database connection is used throughout the entire application, which simplifies connection management in environments with low database traffic.
   - **Pros**:
     - Simple to implement.
     - Works well in low-traffic, single-user scenarios.
   - **Cons**:
     - Not scalable for multi-user or high-load environments.
     - Tightly couples the database connection to the rest of the application, making it less flexible and harder to maintain in the long run.

## Consequences

- **Using Connection Pooling**:
  - **Performance**: Pooling improves performance by reusing connections rather than establishing new ones for each query, which will be particularly useful as the application scales.
  - **Maintainability**: The connection pool abstraction encapsulates the connection management logic, allowing future updates or replacements of the database without affecting the business logic.
  - **Scalability**: Pooling makes the application more scalable, as it can handle a higher volume of concurrent database operations without needing to establish new connections for every query.

- **Using Singleton**:
  - **Simplicity**: The Singleton approach simplifies the architecture for small applications or during the testing phase.
  - **Resource Management**: A single connection might not be sufficient for handling high traffic or concurrent operations, which could lead to resource bottlenecks.
  - **Testing**: For testing purposes, using a singleton is simpler and avoids the complexity of managing a pool of connections. Itâ€™s a good compromise for unit tests or small-scale applications.
